## Code of Conduct – Frontend

We follow the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) within the frontend repository. Expectations:

- Keep design and accessibility feedback respectful and inclusive.
- Critique code and UX artifacts, not people.
- Scrub sensitive wallet or account data from screenshots, recordings, and logs.

Report concerns (subject: “frontend conduct”). Maintainers will investigate and respond per the Contributor Covenant Community Impact Guidelines.
