## About – Frontend

The frontend is the Cannon Ops Console that surfaces deployment workflows, docs, and Safe transactions. Its goals mirror the broader mission while focusing on:

1. **Clarity** – Present Cannon packages, staged txns, and guides in a unified interface.
2. **Speed** – Keep Next.js builds lean and interactive components responsive, even when querying large registries.
3. **Trust** – Ensure wallet connections, search, and command previews are transparent about their data sources.

### In-flight initiatives

- Expand Contentlayer guides to cover more DevOps runbooks.
- Improve search relevance for Cannonfiles and staged transactions.
- Add real-time notifications for Safe quorum thresholds.
